## Dashboards and Visualizations

### Call Center Trends
The first dashboard provides a comprehensive view of call center operations. It offers insights into customer satisfaction levels, examining how well the call center meets customer expectations and where improvements can be made. The dashboard also delves into call handling efficiency, analyzing how quickly and effectively customer queries are addressed. By identifying peak call times, the dashboard helps optimize staffing levels to ensure adequate coverage during busy periods. The breakdown of call topics reveals common issues that customers face, highlighting areas that may require additional resources or training. Furthermore, the dashboard evaluates individual agent performance, enabling the recognition of top performers and the identification of those who may benefit from further development.

### Customer Churn Analysis
This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of factors contributing to customer churn. It explores how different contract types impact customer loyalty, with month-to-month contracts showing a higher likelihood of churn. The analysis also highlights the role of technical support, revealing that customers with a higher number of unresolved tech tickets or those without tech support are more likely to leave. By examining customer tenure, the dashboard shows that newer customers are more prone to churn compared to those with longer relationships with the company. Additionally, the analysis uncovers billing method issues, particularly with electronic cheques and paperless billing, which correlate with higher churn rates. Demographic insights, such as the slight influence of age on churn, are also presented. The dashboard concludes with actionable recommendations to reduce churn, including enhancing technical support, incentivizing longer contracts, improving billing systems, and developing targeted programs for senior citizens.
